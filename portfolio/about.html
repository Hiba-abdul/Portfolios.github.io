            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Abdulmumin Hibatullah Ahuoiza. I hail from Kogi State
                but have lived in Lagos all my life. I have been to different states
                in the country, such as, Abuja, Kwara, and so on. I had both my elementary
                and secondary school education in Lagos State;
                and had my university education in Bells University of Technology, Ota, Ogun State.
                I have always had an interest in Computer Science, from a young age.
                My affinity for coding drove me to pursue my dream of becoming a programmer; to be 
                able to write codes, and create animation. I just graduated from Advanced Frontend
                Certification Course from New Horizons. I am fully capable of handling any task
                brought to me. Also, I am well read in web and mobile development, as well as design.
                Furthermore, I am skilled in both frontend and backend development.
                I hereby formally apply for the position of Senior Frontend Developer in this company.
                Without a doubt, my skills will prove me worthy of such a position. For more 
                information, do well to reach out to me in the contacts section. Thank You.
